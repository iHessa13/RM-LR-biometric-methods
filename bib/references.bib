abstract = {Remote user authentication for Internet of Things (IoT) devices is critical to IoT security, as it helps prevent unauthorized access to IoT networks. Biometrics is an appealing authentication technique due to its advantages over traditional password-based authentication. However, the protection of biometric data itself is also important, as original biometric data cannot be replaced or reissued if compromised. In this paper, we propose a cancelable iris- and steganography-based user authentication system to provide user authentication and secure the original iris data. Most of the existing cancelable iris biometric systems need a user-specific key to guide feature transformation, e.g., permutation or random projection, which is also known as key-dependent transformation. One issue associated with key-dependent transformations is that if the user-specific key is compromised, some useful information can be leaked and exploited by adversaries to restore the original iris feature data. To mitigate this risk, the proposed scheme enhances system security by integrating an effective information-hiding technique-steganography. By concealing the user-specific key, the threat of key exposure-related attacks, e.g., attacks via record multiplicity, can be defused, thus heightening the overall system security and complementing the protection offered by cancelable biometric techniques.},

abstract = {Behavioral bio-metric authentication is considered as a promising approach to securing the internet of things (IoT) ecosystem. In this paper, we investigated the need and suitability of employing voice recognition systems in the user authentication of the IoT. Tools and techniques used in accomplishing voice recognition systems are reviewed, and their appropriateness to the IoT environment are discussed. In the end, a voice recognition system is proposed for IoT ecosystem user authentication. The proposed system has two phases. The first being the enrollment phase consisting of a pre-processing step where the noise is removed from the voice for the enrollment process, the feature extraction step where feature traits are extracted from user’s voice, and the model training step where the voice model is trained for the IoT user. And the second being the phase verifies whether the identity claimer is the owner of the IoT device. Based on the resources limitedness of the IoT technologies, the suitability of text-dependent voice recognition systems is promoted. Likewise, the use of MFCC features is considered in the proposed system.}.

abstract = {ABSTRACTAfter verifying the correctness of the password, the keystroke dynamics‐based authentication (KDA) system will verify the corresponding keystroke features. It provides additional security verification for alphanumeric‐based and personal identification number‐based authentication schemes that suffer from guessing and shoulder surfing attacks. Except for the original time features in the KDA schemes, two novel keystroke features are found in touch screen handheld mobile devices, which are called “pressure” features and “size” features. A computation efficient statistical classifier is built for low‐power mobile devices to authenticate the user's identity. This paper analyzes the following combinations of features: (1) time features; (2) time features and pressure features; (3) time features and size features; and (4) all features combined. The result shows that the size features or the pressure features can effectively promote the utility of the KDA system in personal identification number‐based authentication schemes for touch screen handled mobile devices. The combination of time features and pressure features is the best one for authenticating users. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

abstract = {Data security, complete system control, and missed storage and computing opportunities in personal portable devices are some of the major limitations of the centralized cloud environment. Among these limitations, security is a prime concern due to potential unauthorized access to private data. Biometrics, in particular, is considered sensitive data, and its usage is subject to the privacy protection law. To address this issue, a multimodal authentication system using encrypted biometrics for the edge-centric cloud environment is proposed in this study. Personal portable devices are utilized for encrypting biometrics in the proposed system, which optimizes the use of resources and tackles another limitation of the cloud environment. Biometrics is encrypted using a new method. In the proposed system, the edges transmit the encrypted speech and face for processing in the cloud. The cloud then decrypts the biometrics and performs authentication to confirm the identity of an individual. The model for speech authentication is based on two types of features, namely, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and perceptual linear prediction coefficients. The model for face authentication is implemented by determining the eigenfaces. The final decision about the identity of a user is based on majority voting. Experimental results show that the new encryption method can reliably hide the identity of an individual and accurately decrypt the biometrics, which is vital for errorless authentication.

abstract = {Constant expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices creates considerable convenience for peoples' daily lives; however, it also brings about some challenges. Advanced modern techniques equip IoT devices with additional sensory and communication modules, enabling them to perform more functions than just sensing, but it also means that these devices may consume more energy. Many IoT devices are powered by batteries of limited life and composed of electronic parts of limited capacity. Therefore, energy efficiency is an essential requirement for any IoT device with limited resources in terms of storage space, power, and computing capability. Moreover, possible attack vectors and attack sources for vulnerabilities in the IoT environment present another great challenge for secure user authentication. To address the above issues, in this article we propose a privacy- preserving lightweight biometric system, specifically designed for resource-limited IoT devices to save memory and computational cost. The proposed system employs a block logic operation based algorithm to reduce the biometric feature size in a simple and efficient way. Experimental results demonstrate that with a much reduced feature size, the proposed lightweight biometric system still maintains high recognition accuracy. It is worth noting that any sizable reduction in memory and computing cost is beneficial for resource-constrained IoT devices.},

This requires attackers to simultaneously observe the device screen and the user's eyes to find the password. We evaluate the security and usability of GazeTouchPass in two user studies. Our findings show that GazeTouchPass is usable and significantly more secure than single-modal authentication against basic and even advanced shoulder-surfing attacks.},

abstract = {Mobile devices, namely phones and tablets, have long gone “smart”. Their growing use is both a cause and an effect of their technological advancement. Among the others, their increasing ability to store and exchange sensitive information, has caused interest in exploiting their vulnerabilities, and the opposite need to protect users and their data through secure protocols for access and identification on mobile platforms. Face and iris recognition are especially attractive, since they are sufficiently reliable, and just require the webcam normally equipping the involved devices. On the contrary, the alternative use of fingerprints requires a dedicated sensor. Moreover, some kinds of biometrics lend themselves to uses that go beyond security. Ambient intelligence services bound to the recognition of a user, as well as social applications, such as automatic photo tagging on social networks, can especially exploit face recognition. This paper describes FIRME (Face and Iris Recognition for Mobile Engagement) as a biometric application based on a multimodal recognition of face and iris, which is designed to be embedded in mobile devices. Both design and implementation of FIRME rely on a modular architecture, whose workflow includes separate and replaceable packages. The starting one handles image acquisition. From this point, different branches perform detection, segmentation, feature extraction, and matching for face and iris separately. As for face, an antispoofing step is also performed after segmentation. Finally, results from the two branches are fused. In order to address also security-critical applications, FIRME can perform continuous reidentification and best sample selection. To further address the possible limited resources of mobile devices, all algorithms are optimized to be low-demanding and computation-light.

abstract = {A biometric recognition system is one of the leading candidates for the current and the next generation of smart visual systems. The visual system is the engine of the surveillance cameras that have great importance for intelligence and security purposes. These surveillance devices can be a target of adversaries for accomplishing various malicious scenarios such as disabling the camera in critical times or the lack of recognition of a criminal. In this work, we propose a cross-layer biometric recognition system that has small computational complexity and is suitable for mobile Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Furthermore, due to the involvement of both hardware and software in realizing this system in a decussate and chaining structure, it is easier to locate and provide alternative paths for the system flow in the case of an attack. For security analysis of this system, one of the elements of this system named the advanced encryption standard (AES) is infected by four different Hardware Trojansthat target different parts of this module. The purpose of these Trojans is to sabotage the biometric data that are under process by the biometric recognition system. All of the software and the hardware modules of this system are implemented using MATLAB and Verilog HDL, respectively. According to the performance evaluation results, the system shows an acceptable performance in recognizing healthy biometric data. It is able to detect the infected data, as well. With respect to its hardware results, the system may not contribute significantly to the hardware design parameters of a surveillance camera considering all the hardware elements within the device.},
